<strong>About me </strong>
</p>
<p>

<strong>I‚Äôm Debarpita Dutta, a final year Bioengineering student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. Ever since I have gotten into this interdisciplinary field, I have always been keen to work with data and complexity of Scientia. On the way I have worked on projects and gained certified credibilities to prove who I‚Äôm today in this world of tech and academia. My only motto is, ‚ÄúThey said I cannot, I‚Äôm saying I will‚Äù. Learning is a never ending process, however, this page is built to showcase how diverse the profile of a non cs background student can be. </strong>
