**       DEBARPITA DUTTA’S CERTIFICATIONS**


**THANKYOU FOR HOPPING INTO THIS PAGE**


**About me **


**I’m Debarpita Dutta, a final year Bioengineering student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal. Ever since I have gotten into this interdisciplinary field, I have always been keen to work with data and complexity of Scientia. On the way I have worked on projects and gained certified credibilities to prove who I’m today in this world of tech and academia. My only motto is, “They said I cannot, I’m saying I will”. Learning is a never ending process, however, this page is built to showcase how diverse the profile of a non cs background student can be. **
